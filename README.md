This repository contains a Baba Is You level pack with one level.

The level, when played, simulates cellular automaton rule 110 by default, calculating the next state of the machine each in-game turn. 

The initial state of the machine can be adjusted by pressing space whilst Baba is on top of a zero or one. The parameters of the cellular automaton can also be adjusted similarly.
