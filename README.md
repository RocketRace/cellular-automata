# cellular-automata
*Demonstrating Baba Is You's Turing completeness\* by simulating any arbitrary elementary cellular automata within the game*

\* Given infinite space and memory

---

This repository contains a Baba Is You level pack with one level.

The level, when played, simulates cellular automaton rule 110 by default, calculating the next state of the machine each in-game turn. 
The parameters of the cellular automaton can be adjusted in the level. 
Use of a level editor is recommended for this.
